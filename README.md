[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/alexmerren/speedruncom-scraper)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/alexmerren/speedruncom-scraper)
![Go Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/go%20version-%3E=1.23-61CFDD.svg?style=flat-square)

A series of executables to collect all data available from [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com). A version of the collected data has been published [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexmerren1/speedrun-com-data)!

## ‚¨áÔ∏è  Installation


The repository can be installed easily, and binaries can be compiled with the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:alexmerren/speedruncom-scraper.git
...
$ cd speedruncom-scraper
$ make all
...
```

This project requires:

 * [Golang 1.20+](https://go.dev/dl/)
 * [`gcc` Compatible Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org)

## üöÄ Usage

The compiled binaries can be executed to collect data from the [speedrun.com API](https://github.com/speedruncomorg/api). The following command collects data for all runs, all leaderboards, all games, and all users (who have contributed to leaderboards) on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com):

```bash
./dist/games-list && ./dist/games-data && ./dist/leaderboards-data && ./dist/users-list && ./dist/users-data && ./dist/runs-data
```

Alternatively, there is a Makefile target to run all executables in order:

```bash
make run
```

NOTE: For each executable there are repeated API calls. A local HTTP cache has been implemented to remove repeated API calls from the rate-limited API. This cache is saved locally under `httpcache.db`.

## üèÉ Executables

| Path                                  | Description                                                                                                        | Pre-requisite(s)           |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `./dist/games-list`                   | Retrieve all Game IDs and other data (i.e. total number of runs for a game) for verification in other executables. | None                       |
| `./dist/games-data`                   | Retrieve data on categories, levels, variables, and values, etc. for all game IDs retrieved in `games-list`.       | `./dist/games-list`        |
| `./dist/leaderboards-data`            | Retrieve leaderboard(s) data for all games retrieved in `games-list`. Note: This can fail for games with a high number of runs, use `additional-leaderboards-data` in this case. | `./dist/games-data` |
| `./dist/supplementary-leaderboard-data` | Retrieve leaderboards data for individual games using an overly precise method. Use only if necessary, as it is less efficient. | None |
| `./dist/users-list`                   | Compile a list of all unique users found on all leaderboards of all games‚Äî includes both submitters and verifiers. | `./dist/leaderboards-data` |
| `./dst/users-data`                    | Retrieve non-PII data for all unique users compiled in `users-list`.                                               | `./dist/users-list`        |
| `./dist/runs-data`                    | Retrieve all runs for all unique users compiled in `users-list`. This **should** be all runs on speedrun.com!      | `./dist/users-list`        |
